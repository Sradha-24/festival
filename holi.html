        <img src="holi.jfif" alt="holi" width="500px" height="700px">
        <p>Holi is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love, 
            and Spring. It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.
            Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil, as it commemorates the victory 
            of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu. Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated 
            in the Indian subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western 
            world through the Indian diaspora.</p>
