        <h1>ONAM: THE HARVEST FESTIVAL OF KERALA</h1>
        <img src="onam.jfif" alt="onam" width="500px" height="700px">
        <p>The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is 
marked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is 
celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian 
practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and 
virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam. 
And the other cause for celebrating Onam is because it is the time of the year when a good 
harvest has been gathered all over Kerala, resulting in plenitude and happiness. </p>
